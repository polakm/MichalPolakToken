# Michal Polak Token

This is  project of my personal token based on truffle framework and [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.org/). It is a good example to learn how to use truffle and OpenZeppelin.

<h5>THIS TOKEN HAS NOT BEEN AUDITED AND IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PRODUCTION FUNDS !</h5>

### Free tokens
